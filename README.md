## Implementing of K-means for clustering from scratch and using Sklearn 

## Introduction
This is an implementation of K-means clustering algorithm using Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library for Python. Scikit-learn provides an efficient implementation of K-means algorithm that can be easily used for clustering tasks.

## Files
clustering.ipynb: Python script that contains the implementation of K-means clustering algorithm using Scikit-learn.
Players_22.csv: Sample dataset for clustering.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository directory.
Open the terminal and run the command python clustering.ipynb.
The script will load the sample dataset from data.csv and apply the K-means algorithm with K=3 using Scikit-learn.


## Limitations
The limitations of the K-means algorithm using Scikit-learn are the same as those of the K-means algorithm from scratch. In addition, Scikit-learn has some limitations:

It requires the data to be in the form of a NumPy array or a Pandas dataframe.
It assumes that the number of clusters is known beforehand.
